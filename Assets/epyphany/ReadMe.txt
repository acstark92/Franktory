Thanks for downloading this asset !
I hope you will enjoy it.

These are regular PBR materials .. if you change the tiling, try to keep the ratio intact .. or not :)
Use the Occlusion slider to determine how much ambient light the material is receiving (0=full ambient, 1=no ambient)

About optimization :

- If you are using a top down camera or are aiming for mobiles, then the easiest way to gain performances is to change the max size of the textures .. click on the one you want to change, then in the inspector, change the value of the 'Max size' to your liking (originally 2048) then click 'Apply'. This will make a real big difference. You can batch process this action by selecting multiples textures at once.

- In some of the materials, i use the 'NoiseNormalS' texture as the secondary normal map .. it is a subtle effect that will appear only in extreme close ups conditions. If you don't need extreme close ups shots, then i suggest you put it's value to zero .. it will make a big difference. Depending on your post FX, the 'NoiseNormalS' secondary normal map might also causes some flickering on the screen, if you experience this issue, then just decrease the normal map value or get rid of it completly.

 ----------------

All the textures are seamless and the same size .. so it is very easy to create new materials/variations from this pack.

Have fun :)
